/*
  In this test we test the <new-game-button> directive.

  Here we should test the the directive is rendered correctly and we are able to click on the button it provides
  when the button is clicked a function that is provided to the directive should be called.

  Please mock functions on how to check if functions have been called:
  https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/mock-functions.html

  To trigger changes in the dom you can use angular.element api to find the element rendered
  and use triggerHandler function to fire a click event.
